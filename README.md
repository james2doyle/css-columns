> create a grid using CSS3 columns

### Why Use CSS3 Columns?

Well you can get a lot of really nice layouts that scale down perfectly to mobile. You can really use 1 line of CSS to change your grid, once the spec is complete (curse you vendor prefixes).

### Why Should You Not Use CSS3 Columns

They are buggy. Just try scaling and shrinking the grid in Chrome. It is really strange. Columns will shift and get thrown out of place.

Another thing, is that mixin column heights can cause funny layouts. The whole column spec isn't avaliable just yet. So you can use all the features that make CSS3 columns such a boss.
